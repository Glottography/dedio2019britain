### Coverage

```geojson
{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-25.3, 42.3], [-25.3, 71.3], [31.3, 71.3], [31.3, 42.3], [-25.3, 42.3]]]}, "properties": {}}
```


### Focal year

The source of this dataset investigates the extension of language areas at three distinct epochs
which translate to three different values for the `Year` column in the dataset's `ContributionTable`.
However, these distinct epochs are also almost always reflected in the assigned Glottolog languoid.
E.g. for English, the polygons are assigned to *Old English*, *Middle English* and *English*.
